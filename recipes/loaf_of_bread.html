    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A simple loaf of french bread, perfect to feed your sister's son.</p>
    <p>Very tempting to steal it, but you probably shouldn't.</p>

    <!--ingredients for loaf of bread-->
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 cups warm water, 110-115 degrees F</li>
        <li>2 tbsp granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp instant or active dry yeast</li>
        <li>2 1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li> 2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>5 1/2 - 6 cups bread flour</li>
    </ul>

    <!--instructions for loaf of bread-->
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the water sugar and yeast. If using active dry yeast, let the mixture bubble and foam before proceeding (this can take 3-5 minutes). If using instant yeast, proceed with the recipe (no need to let the yeast activate).</li>
        <li>Add the salt, oil and 3 cups of flour and mix. Add in 2 1/2 to 3 more cups of flour gradually. The dough should clear the sides of the bowl and form a soft ball that doesn't leave a lot of dough residue on your fingers.</li>
        <li>Knead for 2-3 minutes until the dough is smooth. If the dough starts to cling to the sides of the bowl (or the center column if using a Bosch or other mixer with a center), add 1/4 cup of flour at a time until a sturdy but soft ball of dough forms.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl and cover with a towel or greased plastic wrap. Let the dough rise until doubled, about an hour or so, depending on the warmth of your kitchen.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough onto a lightly greased surface and divide in half. Pat each section into a thick rectangle, 9X13-inches or thereabouts (doesn't have to be exact). Roll the dough up starting from the long edge, pressing out any air bubbles or seams with the heel of your hand, and pinch the edge to seal. Arrange seam side down on a large baking sheet lined with parchment paper (I use separate baking sheets for each loaf).</li>
        <li>With a bread lame, razor blade or VERY sharp knife, cut several gashes at an angle on the top each loaf (you can wait to score the bread until after it rises, but it can easily deflate if the razor/knife isn't sharp enough).</li>
        <li>Cover the loaves with greased plastic wrap or a kitchen towel, and let rise until noticeably puffy and nearly doubled in size, about an hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and make sure an oven rack is in the center position. If you find your bread isn't browning as much as you like, preheat the oven to 400 or 425 degrees and/or move the oven rack up one position (watch carefully so the bread, especially the bottom, doesn't burn).</li>
        <li>Bake the loaves for 25-30 minutes until golden and baked through.</li>
    </ol>
